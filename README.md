# Truly Random Number

## *Warning - Run this code on your own personal risk. This code has a storng likelyhood to crash your entire system.*

This is my code to generate completely and truly random numbers. But the problem is that the code requires a lot of power and can easily crash your entire system. The output of the code running for only 10 seconds may be as big as 50MB.
