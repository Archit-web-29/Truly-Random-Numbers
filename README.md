# Truly Random Number

## *Warning - Run this code on your own personal risk. This code has a storng likelyhood to crash your entire system.*

This is my code to generate completely and truly random numbers. But the problem is that the code requires a lot of power and can easily crash your entire system. The output of the code running for only 20 seconds may be as big as 153MB. There is no way to stop the code except restarting the jupyter notebook kernel. Even interrupting the kernel won't work due to high output rate and lag.

You would also have to change the default jupyter notebook IOPub data rate. This code will require more than that.
